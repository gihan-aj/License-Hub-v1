# License Hub (Windows Forms .NET Core)(.NET 8)
License Hub is a C# Windows Forms application designed to manage and issue software licenses. This project showcases my understanding and implementation of object-oriented programming principles and the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) design pattern. While the project is a work in progress, it currently includes several key features and functionalities.

## Learning Outcomes
This project has been a valuable learning experience in several areas:
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Reinforced core OOP concepts such as encapsulation, and abstraction.
* **Model-View-Presenter (MVP) Design Pattern:** Implemented the MVP pattern to separate concerns, making the application more modular, testable, and maintainable.
* **Secure Data Handling:** Integrated encryption and decryption mechanisms to secure sensitive data.
* **File Management:** Gained experience in reading from and writing to JSON files for configuration management.
* **Loose Coupling and Interface Utilization:** Leveraged interfaces and loose coupling to enhance the flexibility and testability of the application.

## Project Status
The License Hub project is not yet complete. The server-side application required for license download and full functionality is still under development. Future work will focus on:
* Completing the server-side application with proper authorization mechanisms.
* Integrating the client application with the server to enable license downloads.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/license-hub.git
   ```
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
3. Build the project to restore dependencies.
